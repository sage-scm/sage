# Getting Started

This guide covers the workflow that exists today while Sage is being restructured.

## 1. Save Your Work

Edit files as needed. When you're ready to commit:

```bash
sg save "Describe your change"
```

Repeat edits and `sg save` as required.

We are actively rebuilding branch stacks, sync, and share flowsâ€”those commands will return in a future release once they are stable.
