# 🌿 Sage

> Burning away Git complexity

Sage wraps everyday Git pain points behind a single, intuitive CLI (installed as `sg`) and an optional sync server for shared stacks. It keeps branch stacks tidy, automates the boring bits, and gives you a slick TUI when you feel fancy – **no magic, no yak shaving, just clean commits**.

👉 **Just getting started?** Read the [Getting Started guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for a walkthrough of the stacked workflow (currently being rebuilt).

> ⚠️ **Alpha in motion:** Sage is in the middle of a major restructuring. Commands, flags, and workflows are being iterated on rapidly and may change without notice while we stabilize the new architecture.

## Why Sage?

* 🌱 **Elegantly simple** – zero mental overhead, readable Rust, no hidden
  side‑effects
* ✨ **DX first** – colourful output, progress bars, AI‑assisted commit
  messages (opt‑in)
* 🪄 **Stack aware** – restack, navigate, submit for review in seconds
* 🔌 **Plugin hooks** – extend every lifecycle stage with your own Rust or
  shell plugins
* 🖥️ **TUI** – full‑screen dashboard

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sage-scm/sage/main/install.sh | sh
```

This script automatically:
- Detects your platform (Linux/macOS/Windows)
- Downloads the appropriate binary
- Verifies checksums for security
- Installs to `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` if needed)

### Manual Download

Download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sage-scm/sage/releases):

- **Linux**: `sage-linux-amd64.tar.gz` (glibc) or `sage-linux-amd64-musl.tar.gz` (musl)
- **macOS**: `sage-macos-amd64.tar.gz` (Intel) or `sage-macos-arm64.tar.gz` (Apple Silicon)  
- **Windows**: `sage-windows-amd64.zip`

All downloads include SHA256 checksums for verification.

### Building from Source

```bash
# Quick developer setup (installs hooks, tools, and builds project)
git clone https://github.com/sage-scm/sage
cd sage
./setup-hooks.sh          # optional, installs shared git hooks
./install-local.sh        # build + install sg from source

# Or build manually:
cargo build --release
./target/release/sg --version

# Try commands without installing
just try work my-feature
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full development setup including Git hooks and code quality tools.

### Package Managers

```bash
# Homebrew (coming soon)
brew install sage-scm/cask/sage

# Cargo
cargo install --git https://github.com/sage-scm/sage sage-cli
```

## Dog‑fooding

We believe in using our own medicine. Throughout development **Sage manages its own repository**—every branch, save, sync, and PR is executed with the `sg` CLI you see taking shape here. Expect real‑world polish to land fast because we feel the pain first.
